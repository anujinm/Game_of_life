record number of live cells for each generatinon





show stats:

	- initial no. of live cells
	- COUNT OF LIVE CELLS !   for every gen
	- count of dead cells         "









FINAL DELIVERABLE   !!!!!

	- graph of live-cells vs. generation    (  1 each for ori, gen, que  )









JUST INFO :

	uses (or usefulness) of this simulation ? :
		- cellular automata
			- public key cryptosystem (cryptography, because they are really complicated, so hard to crack)
		- (soft) artificial life
